# Daily Expense Tracker

This is one of my first Python projects, created while learning through Coddy exercises.

## Features
- Add new expenses
- View all recorded expenses
- Display total and average expense
- Clear all expenses
- Exit the program safely

## Purpose of this Project
I'm documenting my journey learning Python and software development through Coddy.tech  
This project demonstrates:
- Basic list manipulation
- Looping and conditional logic
- User input handling

## Future Improvements
As I learn more, I plan to enhance the project with:
- Input validation to prevent crashes
- Persistent storage (save expenses to file or database)
- Categorizing expenses
- Displaying timestamps for each entry
- A GUI interface (Tkinter)

## How to Run
```bash
python expense_tracker.py
